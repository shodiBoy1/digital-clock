# JavaScript Digital Clock

This project is a simple digital clock built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, along with an AM/PM indicator. The clock is styled minimally and positioned at the center of the page.

## Features

- Displays current time in HH:MM:SS format.
- AM/PM indicator based on the time of day.
- Simple and responsive design that adapts to screen size.
- Updates the time every second for accuracy.

## Setup

To set up the JavaScript Digital Clock on your local environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Open the folder where you've saved the files.
3. Find the `index.html` file and open it in a web browser to view the clock.

## Usage

Once you have the clock running in your browser, it will automatically display the current time. The time updates every second, so you can keep the clock open to track time while you work.

## Customization

You can customize the look of the clock by modifying the `style.css` file. For example, you can change the background color, text color, font size, and font family to match your preferences or website design.
